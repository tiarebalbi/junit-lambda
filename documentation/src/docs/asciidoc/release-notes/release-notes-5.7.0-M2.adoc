[[release-notes-5.7.0-M2-overall-improvements]]
=== Overall Improvements

* Javadoc JARs now contain `package-list` in addition to `element-list` for compatibility
  with tools like NetBeans 11.


[[release-notes-5.7.0-M2-junit-platform]]
=== JUnit Platform

==== Bug Fixes

* Characters in exception messages and other user-supplied values that are not allowed in
  XML are now replaced with their character reference (e.g. `\0` becomes `&#0;`).

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* `EngineTestKit` no longer takes into account implicit configuration parameters (i.e.
  system properties and the `junit-platform.properties` classpath resource) by default.
  This change makes tests executed via `EngineTestKit` independent of the environment they
  are executed in.

==== New Features and Improvements

* When using `ConsoleLauncher`, explicitly selected classes from `--select-class`
  and `--select-method` are now always executed regardless of class name patterns
  provided with `--include-classname` or the default class name pattern.
* Support `FilePosition` in `FileSelector` and `ClasspathResourceSelector`.
* Custom `PostDiscoveryFilter` implementations can now be registered via Java’s
  `ServiceLoader` mechanism.
* New `getJavaClass()` and `getJavaMethod()` methods in
  `org.junit.platform.engine.support.descriptor.MethodSource`.

==== New Features and Improvements

* All `@Enabled*`/`@Disabled*` annotations now have an optional `disabledReason`

  container might be disabled.
* New `assertLinesMatch` method overloads added to class `Assertions` that accept
  two `Stream<String>` instances for comparison.
* `@CsvFileSource` now allows to specify file paths as an alternative to classpath
  resources.
* `JAVA_16` has been added to the `JRE` enum for use with JRE-based execution
  conditions.
